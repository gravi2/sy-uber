# Project
Schedule Your uber (SY-Uber). 

# About
1. This was project I collaborated with my friend (@hbanavar) and was done for the Uber Hackathon (https://uberhackathon.devpost.com/). 
2. As part of this Hackathon, Uber had exposed their new request API and projects were expected to make use of this new API endpoint.

# Status
The backend part of this project was complete and fully functional. The mobile app side of the project was not completed in time for the hackathon.
